### Distribution Selection Justification
I chose to use the ARM64 version of Ubuntu Server. This is widely adopted in enterprise for good reason, as it offers a balance of stability and usability. This is important as it would be my first time configuring a Linux server. Ubuntu server is *easy to use*, offering strong documentation and simple package management for additional software that may be needed for future tasks of the coursework. This is in comparison to CentOS Stream, another server distribution which requires more manual configuration for installing software packages. Another distribution I considered was Debian, a popular and stable operating system. However, I decided against using Debian as it is less up-to-date, as it has a slower release cycle. In addition, Debian requires more configuration for security, while Ubuntu Server is more automated, speeding up the time it will take to set up my VM.

Ubuntu Server is also clearly the best option due to its simple and guided installation process, which is intuitive and requires less manual setup and knowledge to get started. It is designed to be accessible for new Linux users, with beginner-friendly documentation and simple package management. This is in contrast to CentOS Stream or Debian, which require more configuration knowledge with their more complex setup processes. These distributions are more geared towards experienced server administrators, and require more learning than would be possible during the timescale of the coursework.

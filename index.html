        <h3>System Architecture Diagram</h3>
        <div class="diagram">

        <h3>Distribution Selection Justification</h3>
        <p>
          I chose to use the ARM64 version of Ubuntu Server. This is widely adopted in enterprise for good reason, as it
          offers a balance of stability and usability.
          This is important as it would be my first time configuring a Linux server. Ubuntu Server is easy to use,
          offering strong documentation and simple package management
          for additional software that may be needed for future tasks of the coursework.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is in comparison to CentOS Stream, another server distribution which requires more manual configuration
          for installing software packages.
          Another distribution I considered was Debian, a popular and stable operating system. However, I decided
          against using Debian as it is less up-to-date,
          as it has a slower release cycle. In addition, Debian requires more configuration for security, while Ubuntu
          Server is more automated, speeding up the time
          it will take to set up my VM.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ubuntu Server is also clearly the best option due to its simple and guided installation process, which is
          intuitive and requires less manual setup and knowledge to get started.
          It is designed to be accessible for new Linux users, with beginner-friendly documentation and simple package
          management. This is in contrast to CentOS Stream or Debian,
          which require more configuration knowledge with their more complex setup processes.
        </p>
        <p>
          These distributions are more geared towards experienced server administrators, and require more learning than
          would be possible during the timescale of the coursework.
        </p>

        <h3>Workstation Configuration</h3>
        <p>
          My workstation is a MacBook Pro with the macOS Tahoe (version 26) operating system installed. This is my
          primary device, and is good for virtualisation due to the Apple Silicon ARM architecture and Apple’s
          virtualisation and hypervisor frameworks.
          Due to said CPU architecture, the version of Ubuntu Server I have to install will have to be the ARM64 build
          due to the performance issues that would be introduced.
        </p>
        <p>
          macOS is part of the UNIX family of operating systems, which has many similarities with Linux. This reduces
          compatibility issues as a lot of the kernel level features are the same,
          meaning the virtualised server will be more stable and performant. UNIX-based hosts such as macOS also come
          with Linux tools such as built-in SSH via the Terminal, which means connecting
          to the server will be easier, not requiring the installation of PuTTY like on Windows hosts.
        </p>

        <h3>Network Configuration</h3>
        <p>When configuring the network connection between my server VM and my workstation, I will use the "Bridged
          Adapter" option within VirtualBox to ensure the server VM is hosted on the same network as my workstation.
          This connects the guest network interface to the host's, appearing as a seperate device on the local network.
          This allows connection to the guest machine via SSH without requiring port forwarding or NAT to be configured.
          This means that the server VM can be connected to from the local machine with a simple SSH connection.
        </p>

        <h3>System Specifications</h3>
        <p>The specifications of my server VM are as follows:

        <h2 id="planning-title">Security Planning and Testing Methodology</h2>
        <div class="meta">31/10/2025 🎃</div>

        <h3>Performance Testing Plan</h3>
        <p>
          In my performance testing plan, I will monitor my server VM's metrics to ensure system stability, and collect
          data
          for capacity planning.<br><br>
          For remote monitoring, I will use the <code>htop</code> tool to view processes running, <code>iostat</code> to
          see CPU statistics,
          <code>netstat</code> to view current network connections and bandwidth usage, and <code>vmstat</code> to see
          how much virtual memory is being used, so I can increase the "physical" memory if required.
          Key performance indicators (KPIs) I will track will include:
        <ul>
          <li>CPU Utilisation</li>
          <li>Memory Usage</li>
          <li>Disk I/O</li>
          <li>Network Throughput</li>
        </ul>
        From these tests, I would like to determine how certain stresses affect response time through SSH. I could use
        stress testing tools such as <code>stress-ng</code> and <code>sysbench</code>.
        </p>
        <h3>Security Configuration Checklist</h3>
        <p>
          I will edit the SSH configuration file editing various settings to ensure the security of my VM instance.
          While the risk of attack is low as it is on my own local network, security measures are still implemented to
          follow best practice.
        <ul>
          <li>Using key based authentication instead of passwords, as these cannot be as easily stolen/brute forced.
          </li>
          <li>Installing "Fail2ban", this is a tool that bans IP addresses that show malicious behaviours like too many
            password attempts.</li>
          <li>Configuring a firewall using the <code>ufw</code> command, only allowing necessary ports for SSH and
            HTTP(S).</li>
          <li>Enable <code>unattended-upgrades</code> to automatically install security updates.</li>
          <li>I could scan for open ports that don't need to be open, to tighten security.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Security Threat Model</h3>
        <p>
          My threat model will identify three security threats and propose mitigation strategies for them. <br>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Unauthorised Access:</b> The mitigation for this would be to use strong passwords,
            or to use the key-based authentication that I mentioned above. This would prevent access to the server VM
            from bad actors.</li>
          <li><b>Malware/Ransomware:</b> If malware is unknowingly installed on the system, data could be stolen or the
            system could
            cease functioning, meaning that my coursework would be disrupted. Mitigation for this includes enabling
            <code>unattended-upgrades</code> (as mentioned above), and potentially installing an antivirus program.
            Backups of the virtual machine, saving its state at each stage so that I can rollback at any time.
          </li>
          <li><b>Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks: </b>Fail2ban and firewall configuration can be used to prevent an
            attacker flooding my system
            with malicious traffic which would prevent me from working. In addition, I could configure rate limiting
            preventing an influx of requests fron a single IP address.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>

            <td>Provides clean measureable data. Perfect for bandwidth and latency tests.</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        </p>

        <h3>Expected Resource Profiles</h3>
        <p>Based on the selected applications, I anticipate the following resource behaviors:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>CPU Tests:</b> The <code>stress-ng</code> CPU stressors should drive user-space CPU utilization to near
            100%. I expect to see the system load average rise significantly above the number of available cores (which
            is 2 in this VM). This will verify if the virtual CPU allocation is sufficient for high-demand tasks.</li>
          <li><b>Memory Tests:</b> RAM stressors will rapidly consume available memory. I anticipate seeing the "free"
            memory drop close to zero. If the stressor exceeds physical RAM (approx 2GB), I expect to see swap usage
            ("si" and "so" columns in vmstat) increase, resulting in degraded system responsiveness.</li>
          <li><b>I/O Tests:</b> The <code>fio</code> benchmarks will saturate the virtual disk controller. I expect high
            read/write throughput and a notable spike in "iowait" percentages during heavy random access tests, which
            will help benchmark the underlying storage performance.</li>
          <li><b>Network Tests:</b> <code>iperf3</code> should saturate the virtual network adapter. I expect to see
            consistent throughput matching the provisioned bandwidth of the bridged adapter, potentially reaching
            gigabit speeds on the local network.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Monitoring Strategy</h3>
        <p>
          To effectively capture performance data during these tests, I will employ a "split-terminal" strategy using
          two simultaneous SSH connections:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Terminal A (Load Generator):</b> This session will execute the benchmark commands (e.g.,
            <code>stress-ng</code> or <code>fio</code>).
          </li>
          <li><b>Terminal B (Monitor):</b> This session will run real-time monitoring tools. I will use
            <code>htop</code> for a visual overview of processes and <code>vmstat 1</code> to capture second-by-second
            granular data on memory, swap, and CPU activity.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          For the final report, I will pipe the output of the monitoring tools to log files (e.g.,
          <code>vmstat 1 > cpu_test_log.txt</code>) to generate graphs. I will also verify system stability by checking
          <code>dmesg</code> or <code>/var/log/syslog</code> for any kernel errors or OOM (Out of Memory) killer events
          that may occur during the stress tests.
        </p>

        <h3>Configuring SSH with key-based authentication</h3>

        </div>
        <p>After this, I copied the key to the server using the <code>ssh-copy-id</code> command. I had to specify the

        <p>To harden my SSH configuration, I first backed up my initial configuration file using the <code>cp</code>
          command. Then, I edited the configuration file using <code>sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>. I
          uncommented the PasswordAuthentication line and set it to no. I also uncommented the PubkeyAuthentication line
          and set it to yes. I then restarted the SSH service using <code>sudo systemctl restart sshd</code>.</p>

        <p>These changes improve security by removing the ability to authenticate with a password, which is less secure
          as it can be easily brute forced, and passwords can be potentially stolen.</p>
        <p>In addition, disabling root login improves security by reducing the attack surface, since hackers can no
          longer target the root account which is fully privileged.</p>

        <h3>Configuring a firewall permitting SSH from one specific workstation only</h3>
        <p>To implement firewall rules, I first checked UFW was installed using <code>sudo apt install ufw</code>.</p>
        <p>Once I had confirmed UFW was installed, I then began setting the rules for my firewall. I used the commands
          below:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
  sudo ufw default deny incoming
  sudo ufw default allow outgoing
  sudo ufw allow from 10.0.2.2 to any port 22
  sudo ufw enable</code>
        </pre>
        <p>After running these commands, I tested the firewall by trying to connect to my server via SSH from my
          workstation. I was able to connect successfully. Below is a table explaining each rule I set, and a screenshot
          from the VM documenting the ruleset.</p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Rule</th>
            <th>Explanation</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>sudo ufw default deny incoming</td>
            <td>This rule denies all incoming traffic by default, which helps prevent unauthorized access to the server.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>sudo ufw default allow outgoing</td>
            <td>This rule allows all outgoing traffic by default, which helps ensure that the server can access the
              internet and other resources.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>sudo ufw allow from 10.0.2.2 to any port 22</td>
            <td>This rule allows SSH traffic from the workstation IP address (10.0.2.2) to the server on port 22.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>sudo ufw enable</td>
            <td>This rule enables the firewall, making the ruleset active.</td>
          </tr>

        <h3>Managing users and implement privilege management, creating a non-root administrative user</h3>
        <p>It is good practice to have a non-root user with sudo permissions, as it reduces the attack surface of the
          system.</p>
        <p>First, I created a new user using the <code>sudo adduser adminuser</code> command.</p>
        <p>Then, I added the user to the sudo group using the <code>sudo usermod -aG sudo adminuser</code> command.</p>
        <p>To verify that the user was added to the sudo group, I used the <code>groups adminuser</code> command.</p>
        <p>I also used the <code>id adminuser</code> command to verify that the user was added to the sudo group.</p>
        <p>To test sudo access, I used the following commands:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
  su - adminuser
  sudo apt update
  whoami
  getent group sudo</code>
        </pre>
        <p>Below are screenshots displaying the process of creating a user. The principle of least privilege is
          important because it reduces the attack surface of the system. </p>
